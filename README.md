Using distro code and completing a program to use a sorting algorithm as well as binary search

Search very simply impliments distro code in an effort to generate random numbers into an array, reorganize the array until it's in order, and then search through the array using binary search. This is a small step towards learning how to read other people's contributions and commiting contributions on top of what was configured.

This set of code also introduces the abilities of creating, or in this case modifying, the Makefile that compiles the code.

This program was configured for the purpose of solving a problem set from an EDX course.
